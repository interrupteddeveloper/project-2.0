Explanation:

In the HTML (index.html), we have a simple structure consisting of a title, a container for the password generator, an input field to display the generated password, and a button to trigger the password generation process.

The CSS (styles.css) provides basic styling to center the content on the page, style the input and button, and create a clean visual layout.

In the JavaScript (script.js), we first get references to the elements we need: the "Generate Password" button and the input field for the password output.

The generatePassword function generates a random password by selecting characters from a predefined set of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. The password length is set to 12 characters.

A loop runs to generate each character of the password by picking a random character from the characters string using a random index.

The generated password is then displayed in the input field, updating its value.

An event listener is attached to the "Generate Password" button, so when it's clicked, the generatePassword function is called to generate and display a random password.

When you open the HTML file in a web browser, you'll see a simple page with a button. Clicking the button will generate and display a random password in the input field below the button.
